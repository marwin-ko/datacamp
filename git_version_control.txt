# What does git do?
# keep track of changes to files
# notice conflicts between changes made by different users
# synchronize files between different computers

# What is a repo?
# Repository is a combination of two things: files/directories and extra info that git records (.git) about project's history
# .git is located in the root directory of the repo
# you should never edit or delete anything in .git

# see what's staged or committed
git status 

# see differences
# @@ tells where changes are being made
# pairs of numbers are "start line" and "number of lines"
git diff # see all diffs
git diff filename # see diff on file
git diff directory # see diff on directory


#
# Save (add/commit/push)
#

# stage 
git add filename

# compare the state of your file with those in staging
git diff -r HEAD 
# -r flag means "compare to a particular revision" 
# HEAD is shortcut meaning "the most recent commit"
git diff -r HEAD path/file
# restrict the results to a single file or directory


#
# commit
#
# use git commit to save changes in staging area
# it saves everything that is in the staging area as one unit
# when you want to undo changes to project, you undo all of a commit or none of it.

git commit -m 'message'
# if you need to change original commit message
git commit --amnd -m 'new message'
